# Maya AI Voice Assistant

## Introduction

“Maya AI Voice Assistant” is a cross-platform application developed in Flutter. It harnesses the capabilities of OpenAI’s GPT and DALL-E APIs to create an engaging voice assistant. The application is themed around “Maya”, an ancient Indian mystical woman, providing a unique and captivating user interface.



## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: The application allows users to interact using voice commands. The `speech_to_text: ^6.3.0` library is used to transcribe speech into text.
- **Dynamic Responses**: The assistant can provide responses in both text and image formats based on the user’s input. The GPT API determines the type of response expected.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Text responses are converted into audio using `flutter_tts: ^3.7.0`, offering a more immersive user experience.
- **Image Saving**: Users can download and save images generated by DALL-E directly to their device.
